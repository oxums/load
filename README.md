# Load Editor

Lightweight text editor for quick file editing tasks.

### Design inspiration

Zed.dev, my current favorite text editor.

## Made for an hackaton

This project was made for the Build-a-thon hackaton and some things aren't polished.
Copilot AI was used in the development mainly for boilerplate code / boring tasks.

## todo

- general polish
- AI integration (to be finished)

# known issues

- adding newline at the end of file makes view jump up
- viewport dosent follow cursor
