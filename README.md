# Load Editor

Lightweight text editor for quick file editing tasks.

### Design inspiration

Zed.dev, my current favorite text editor.

## Made for an hackaton

This project was made for the Build-a-thon hackaton and some things aren't polished.
Copilot AI was used in the development mainly for boilerplate code / boring tasks.

## todo

- hide error / warnings
- improve file tree UI
- general polish
- settings button
- AI integration (ollama or something)
